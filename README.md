My 8th assignment, and one that was a bit tougher. I understood the concept from try catch in js, but it was a bit tricky to get used to here as the implementation this time is wider than I was used to. I had mainly used it within my APIs to try certain operations on the database and log an error, rather than having it as the structure of an application. Not a bad thing and I'm glad to have had the opportunity to see it done this way.
